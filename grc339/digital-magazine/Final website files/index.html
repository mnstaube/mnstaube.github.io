                                   The Outsiders is a 1983 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is an adaptation of the 1967 novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton and was released on March 25, 1983, in the United States.

                                    There are few gaming legends as instantly recognisable as Pac-Man. Beginning in 1980 with the original dot-munching classic, the small round yellow star went on to feature in a host of brilliant arcade games across the decade.

                                    The 1980s saw the emergence of electronic dance music and new wave, also known as Modern Rock. As disco fell out of fashion in the decade's early years, genres such as post-disco, Italo disco, Euro disco, and dance-pop became more popular.

                                    In a world of no fashion influencers and no social media, 80s fashion drew inspiration from music and TV shows, creating more style idols than in any previous fashion decade.

                                    The 1980s was a decade of meteoric growth, both for the global economic system and for the art world that swung in its orbit. Cocaine, MTV, the personal computer, the collapse of state-sponsored socialism: these were heady times for the neoliberal regimes installed in Deng Xiaoping’s China, Margaret Thatcher’s Great Britain, and Ronald Reagan’s United States.

                                    Without a doubt, the '80s was the decade that the activity truly became popular. Whereas beforehand people spent their leisure time playing traditional games and sports, the '80s saw a boom in new, exciting ways to spend the weekends and evenings.

                                    During the 1980s, conservative politics and Reaganomics held sway as the Berlin Wall crumbled, new computer technologies emerged and blockbuster movies and MTV reshaped pop culture.
