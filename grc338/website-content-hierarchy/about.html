                    Udderly Obsessed Ice Cream is a new American ice cream parlor, focused on serving texture-driven small-batch ice creams with a renewed attention to flavor and palate. Owner and founder Nicholas Morgenstern develops each
                    recipe specifically for each individual flavor. The integrity of his ingredients are never compromised with additives or processed stabilizing. “Each ice cream is made with the flavor profile in mind first.” With this
                    hands-on approach, Udderly Obsessed looks to change the way people eat and think about this nostalgic treat, by giving ice cream lovers an entirely original and contemporary ice cream experience.
